# Rasters
Today the topic was rasters. The task was to use a raster and also to attempt to make something distorted and rotate things. I also used a transparent black background-fill to get a bit of a trail on all movements.

The Initial Idea for this was brainstormed in PDF here: [[Idea Sketch.pdf]] 

The result looks a bit different- Instead of shooting balls trough the scene, I decided to add randomness and randomly "light up" a circle.

Circles are "light up" by wrapping a sine wave around them. The frequency and amplitude of that wave are two natural parameters of this.

The entire Idea is heavily inspired by visualizations and expressions used to describe string theory.
